-	one of worst films of 2002
-	one thing is for sure this movie does not tell you whole lot about lily chou chou
+	thoroughly engaging , surprisingly touching british comedy
+	and their kids will have barrie good time
-	time machine is movie that has no interest itself it does n't believe itself , it has no sense of humor it 's just plain bored
-	uneven mix of dark satire childhood
+	sensitive , treatment of greene 's work as well as remarkably faithful one
+	it 's type of film about growing up that we do n't see often enough these days realistic , urgent , not in least
-	director has self consciousness into proceedings at every turn results are far more alienating than involving
-	it tries too hard , overreaches logic of its own world
-	looks feels like project better suited for small screen
-	while resident evil games may have set new standards for thrills , suspense , gore for video games , movie really only succeeds the third of these
-	first fatal attraction was vile enough do we really need tiger beat version ?
+	have tremendous chemistry their sexual and romantic tension , while never really , is palpable
+	densely constructed , highly referential film , an audacious return to form that can comfortably sit among jean luc godard 's finest work
+	dark disturbing , but also surprisingly funny
-	what 's next my mother car ?
-	i 'm sure filmmakers found this remarkable novel concept , but anybody who has ever seen independent film can report that it is instead cheap clich
+	it 's all together with energy , intelligence verve , by surplus of vintage footage
+	whenever it to get bogged down earnest , stirring visual sequence like surge through rapids or leap from to rouses us if horses could fly , this is surely what they 'd look like
+	based on barry 's popular book of same name , movie benefits from having real writer plot out all of characters ' moves overlapping story
-	jumbled fantasy comedy that did not figure out coherent game plan at , shooting or post production stages
+	remarkably insightful look at backstage angst of stand up comic
-	redeeming feature of chan 's films has always been action , but stunts the tuxedo seem tired , what 's worse , routine
-	it would be hard to think of recent movie that has worked this hard to achieve this little fun
-	clich d shallow cautionary tale about hard lives of gay men
-	more than anything
+	viewed on its own terms , treasure planet is better than average family entertainment , but true fans of stevenson 's novel will likely prefer disney 's more faithful 1950 live action swashbuckling classic
+	komediant is tale worth catching
+	campanella gets tone just right funny the middle of sad the middle of hopeful
-	it will probably prove interesting to ram dass fans , but to others it may feel like parody of mellow , peace love side of '60s
+	hardly objective documentary , but it 's great cinematic love moore or him , you 've got to admire intensity with which he 's willing to express his convictions
+	film exudes urbane sweetness that woody allen seems to have forsaken
+	that jack nicholson makes this man so watchable is tribute not only to his craft , but to his legend
-	movie like guys is why film criticism can be considered work
+	offers interesting look at rapidly changing face of beijing
-	chooses to present ah na 's life as slight , weightless fairy tale , whose most unpleasant details seem to away face of the character 's blank faced optimism
+	it 's fun , , wise surprisingly inoffensive for film about teen love with his
-	after while , only way for reasonably intelligent person to get through country bears is to ponder how whole segment of pop music history has been allowed to get wet , fuzzy sticky
-	most opaque , self indulgent just plain goofy excuse for movie as you can imagine
+	humorous heartfelt , douglas mcgrath 's version of ` nicholas nickleby ' left me feeling and hopeful not many movies have that kind of impact on me these days
+	often hilarious , well shot , importantly , entertaining , hell house is fascinating document of event that has to be seen to be believed
-	instead of panoramic sweep , kapur gives us episodic , the story 's emotional
+	lean , deftly shot , well acted , weirdly retro thriller that recalls raft of '60s '70s european set spy pictures
-	poky pseudo serious exercise sham actor and affected
+	charm of first movie is still there , story feels like logical , unforced of the careers of pair of spy kids
+	it 's charming often affecting journey
+	stephen earnhart 's documentary skinner blues has nothing but love for its of trailer park denizens
+	leigh makes these lives count he allows gawky actor like who could too easily become comic relief any other film to reveal his impressively delicate range
-	ending does n't work but most of movie works so well i 'm almost it , anyway maybe not to everybody , but certainly to people with curiosity about how movie can go very right , then step wrong
+	possession is elizabeth browning meets drew , it 's directed by neil labute
-	episode ii of clones is technological exercise that lacks and delight
+	moody horror thriller by deft and director 's well known narrative gamesmanship
+	its almost too spectacular setting slightly from eccentric good aimless story
-	silly stuff , all mixed up together like term paper from kid who ca n't quite distinguish one sci fi work from another
-	slap me , i saw this movie
+	exude chemistry comfort level that 's both saucy and endearing
-	at three hours with very little story or character development , there is plenty of room for editing , much shorter cut surely would have in a smoother , more focused narrative without sacrificing any of cultural intrigue
+	gheorghiu as famous donna tosca , roberto as her mario , ruggero as villainous , police chief , all beautifully act adequately
+	romanek keeps film constantly taut the character 's with metaphorical visual style an unnerving , like score
-	tuxedo should have been vehicle for chan that mask was for jim alas , it 's man that makes clothes
-	wanders all over map thematically stylistically , borrows heavily from lynch , , von while failing to find spark of its own
+	if you dig on david mamet 's mind tricks rent this movie enjoy !
+	this urban study with references to folktales , villeneuve creates maelstrom world where bizarre is credible the real turns magical
+	fascinating , documentary that should shame americans , regardless of whether or not ultimate blame finally lies with kissinger should be required viewing for classes would be public alike
-	given that both movies expect us to root for violent over those to us from same , we need every bit of sympathy cons can muster this time , there is n't much
+	this is very funny , heartwarming film it has fun with quirks of family life , but it also treats subject with and respect
+	message of such intentional or not is that while no art grows from vacuum , many artists exist one
-	there 's nothing interesting unfaithful
-	like coming into long running , well written television series where you 've missed first half dozen episodes probably wo n't see next six
-	i loved looking at this movie i just did n't care as much for story
-	alternative medicine obviously has its merits but ayurveda does field no favors
-	gimmick search of movie how to get carvey into as many silly costumes deliver as many silly voices as possible , plot mechanics be damned
-	perhaps most annoying thing about who is cletis tout ? is that it 's crime movie made by someone who obviously knows nothing about crime
+	robert harmon 's less is more approach delivers real night chills his greatest triumph is keeping creepy hidden in the film 's thick shadows
+	this is startling film that gives you fascinating , albeit depressing view of iranian rural life close to iraqi border
-	this is n't even movie we can enjoy as mild escapism it is one which fear frustration are to intolerable levels
-	sometimes it feels as if it might have been made the '70s or , starred chase goldie hawn
-	boring , formulaic mix of serial killers stalk'n ` slash
+	compelling as it is exotic , fast runner has plot that shakespeare for intrigue , and murder
-	it takes talent to make lifeless movie about most man who ever lived
-	to say analyze that is de niro 's best film since meet parents up sad state of his recent career
-	how inept is serving sara ? it makes even elizabeth hurley seem graceless ugly
-	it made me want to my eyes out of my head toss them at screen
